Exploratory Data Analysis on the Suicide Rates

Through bivariate analysis we try to analyze two variables simultaneously. As opposed to univariate analysis where we check the characteristics of a single variable, in bivariate analysis we try to determine if there is any relationship between two 
variables.

&nbsp;

There are essentially 3 major scenarios that we will come across when we perform bivariate analysis
1. Both variables of interest are qualitative
2. One variable is qualitative and the other is quantitative
3. Both variables are quantitative

&nbsp;

For the purpose of this exercise, we will explore few most popular techniques to perform bivariate analysis.

The following plots are not limited to the headings they are under. They are the options we have if we face a certain scenario.

## Numerical  vs. Numerical
    1. Scatterplot
    2. Line plot
    3. Heatmap for correlation
    4. Joint plot
    
## Categorical vs. Numerical
    1. Bar chart
    2. Violin plot
    3. Categorical box plot
    4. Swarm plot
    
    
## Two Categorical Variables 
    1. Bar chart
    2. Grouped bar chart
    3. Point plot
